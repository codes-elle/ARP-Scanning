## Theoretical Questions
 1. What is ARP and what role does it play in networking?
  Explain the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) and its purpose in a network.

2. How does an ARP request differ from an ARP reply?
Describe the difference between ARP request and ARP reply packets.

3. Why is ARP scanning useful in network security and management?
Discuss the applications of ARP scanning in network security and management.

4. What are the potential risks or downsides of using ARP scanning on a network?
Explain any security concerns or potential disruptions caused by ARP scanning.

5. What is an ARP cache poisoning attack?
Define ARP cache poisoning and its implications on network security.

## Practical Questions
1. Write a Python script using Scapy to perform an ARP scan on a specified IP range.
  Provide the code for an ARP scanning script and explain how it works.

2. Modify the ARP scanning script to save the discovered IP and MAC addresses to a file.
  Update the script to output results to a file instead of the console.

3. How can you filter the ARP scan results to display only devices from a specific manufacturer (based on MAC address)?
  Write a script modification to filter devices by MAC address prefix.

4. Extend the ARP scanning script to resolve and display the hostname of each discovered device.
  Add functionality to the script to perform reverse DNS lookups on the discovered IP addresses.

5. Compare the output of the ARP scan with the output of the arp -a command on your system. What differences do you observe, and why might they occur?
  Run an ARP scan and compare the results with the system ARP cache.

6. Discuss how you can ensure that your ARP scanning script does not overwhelm the network.
  Provide strategies for minimizing network impact when performing ARP scans.

7. How can you detect and prevent ARP spoofing attacks using a script?
  Write a script to monitor ARP traffic and detect potential ARP spoofing.
